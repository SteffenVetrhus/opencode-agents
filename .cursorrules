# OpenCode Agents - Google Antigravity Configuration

This project provides specialized AI agents optimized for different development tasks.
Configuration files are located in `.antigravity/` directory.

## Available Agent Modes

Use these commands to activate specific agent personas:

- `/arch` - Senior Solution Architect (complexity assessment, phased delivery)
- `/beagle` - Research Agent (information gathering, source verification)
- `/coder` - Autonomous Coding Agent (implementation, debugging, testing)
- `/writer` - Creative Writing Agent (documentation, narrative content)

## General Principles

- All agents use English for communication and documentation
- Extended reasoning mode enabled for deep analysis
- Agents respond in the language of the user's query when appropriate
- Internal processing always in English

## Model Preferences

- Primary: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (for balanced performance)
- Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro (for Google ecosystem integration)
- Deep reasoning: Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Deep Think

## Permission Philosophy

- `arch` - Extended thinking, may request file operations
- `beagle` - Asks before editing/writing/bash
- `coder` - Full autonomy (edit/write/read allowed)
- `writer` - Creative freedom, bash denied for safety

For detailed agent definitions, see `.antigravity/rules.md`
